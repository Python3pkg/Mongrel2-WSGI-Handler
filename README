Date: 3 August 2010

This is a very basic WSGI Handler for Mongrel2 (http://mongrel2.org/home). It is based on SimpleHandler from de wsgi reference implementation in Python 2.6 or higher.

The currently handles a couple of simple WSGI application. It also handles a demo Django WSGI application, see http://github.com/berry/Django-demo.

Known issues:
- this wsgi handler currently doesn't support chunked responses. I haven't figured out yet how to do this.
